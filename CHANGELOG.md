## Purchase Orders

- Opening a new purchase order generates a purchase order with an opdated PO number and date, and saves it inside its corresponding folder in the "PO's" directory of the program

## Backups

- Backups don't generate whenever you close the program, as uploading the inventory to the database is better.
- Drag a backup onto the program to load said backup, no idea why, but its an option that I thought would be cool to add.

## Website

<a style='text-decoration:none;color:cyan'href='<https://piney-manufacturing-inventory.herokuapp.com'><https://piney-manufacturing-inventory.herokuapp.com>></a>

<h3>Inventory Menu</h3>
